Welcome to my new portfolio :) It's still work in progress, but feel free to have a look around! 

## Instructions 
To run these files locally, git clone the repository and then run 'npm install'. 

_PS: You might need to install the Vue CLI to make the server run: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html, but 'npm install' should be enough._
